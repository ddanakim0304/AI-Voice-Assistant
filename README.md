# JARVIS AI Interface

A voice-controlled AI assistant inspired by JARVIS from Marvel, built using Node.js and OpenAI APIs.

## Key Learnings

- **Audio Processing**: Integrated `node-microphone` and `ffmpeg` for recording and processing audio.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Implemented speech-to-text with Whisper, and GPT-4 for generating JARVIS-like responses.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converted AI responses to speech using OpenAI's audio API.
- **Error Handling**: Managed API, I/O, and async errors efficiently.
- **Environment Management**: Secured API keys with `.env` files.
